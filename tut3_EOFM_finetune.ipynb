    "# Fine-tuning Clay Foundation Model for Land Cover Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Tutorial 3! In this hands-on session, you'll learn how to fine-tune the Clay foundation model for land cover segmentation using the Chesapeake Bay dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/developmentseed/igarss25tutorial/blob/main/tut3_EOFM_finetune.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Understand what foundation models are and why they're powerful for Earth observation\n",
    "- Learn how to fine-tune a pre-trained model for semantic segmentation\n",
    "- Apply transfer learning techniques to land cover classification\n",
    "- Work with real satellite imagery and ground truth labels\n",
    "- Evaluate model performance on geospatial data\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Build\n",
    "You'll create a land cover segmentation model that can classify different types of land use (water, forest, urban areas, etc.) from satellite imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background for Different Audiences\n",
    "\n",
    "### For GIS Professionals 📍\n",
    "- **Foundation models** are like having a universal \"base map\" that understands Earth's features\n",
    "- **Segmentation** is similar to creating detailed land use polygons, but at the pixel level\n",
    "- Think of this as automated land cover classification that can replace manual digitization\n",
    "- The output is similar to creating a detailed land use/land cover (LULC) raster\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Data Analysts 📊  \n",
    "- We're using **transfer learning** - starting with a model already trained on lots of Earth imagery\n",
    "- **Fine-tuning** means adapting this pre-trained model to our specific classification task\n",
    "- This is like taking a general-purpose tool and customizing it for your specific needs\n",
    "- The model learns patterns in pixel values to predict land cover categories\n",
    "\n",
    "### For ML Engineers 🤖\n",
    "- Clay is a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** trained on massive Earth observation datasets\n",
    "- We're doing **semantic segmentation** - predicting a class for every pixel\n",
    "- The architecture uses a **frozen encoder** (Clay) + **trainable segmentation head**\n",
    "- We'll use PyTorch Lightning for training orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "The **Chesapeake Bay Land Cover dataset** contains:\n",
    "- **High-resolution aerial imagery** (NAIP - National Agriculture Imagery Program)\n",
    "- **7 land cover classes**: Water, Tree Canopy, Low Vegetation, Barren, Impervious (Roads), Impervious (Other), No Data\n",
    "- **Pixel-level annotations** for supervised learning\n",
    "- **Real-world complexity** with mixed land uses and seasonal variations"

    "## How the Clay Segmentation Architecture Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Segmentor` class combines two key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Frozen Clay Encoder** 🧊\n",
    "- Pre-trained on millions of Earth observation images\n",
    "- Extracts rich feature representations from input imagery  \n",
    "- **Frozen** = weights don't change during fine-tuning (saves compute!)\n",
    "- Acts like a \"universal feature extractor\" for Earth imagery\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Trainable Segmentation Head** 🎯  \n",
    "- Takes Clay's feature maps and upsamples them to original image size\n",
    "- Uses **convolution + pixel shuffle** operations for efficient upsampling\n",
    "- **Only this part gets trained** - much faster than training from scratch!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Parameters:**\n",
    "- `num_classes (int)`: Number of land cover classes to predict (7 for Chesapeake)\n",
    "- `ckpt_path (str)`: Path to the pre-trained Clay model weights\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Approach Works:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Faster training**: Only train the small segmentation head\n",
    "- ✅ **Less data needed**: Clay already understands Earth imagery patterns  \n",
    "- ✅ **Better performance**: Foundation model knowledge transfers well\n",
    "- ✅ **Cost effective**: Requires fewer computational resources"
